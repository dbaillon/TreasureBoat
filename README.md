TreasureBoat v.0.1 (MileStone 1)
============

Initial source for a WOString replacement and a java agent are here in Sources. These
class-overriding that we want is not yet working. After this works, the code will be
moved around into a more extensible arrangement, with multiple frameworks and so on.

###Important
* Eclipse 4.3.2
* Java 8
* WOLips (under Development)
* Maven Project (FluffyBunny is Legacy)
